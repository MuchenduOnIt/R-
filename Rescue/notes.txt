VECTOR NAMES
Entries in avector can and normally should be "named". It is 
a way of associating a numeric reading with a simple id, 
VECTOR ARITHMETIC
Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions, in which case the 
operatinos are performed element by element to produce another vector.
More Arithmetic;
  var()
  sum()
  summary()
  
GENERATING REGULAR SEQUENCES:
seq(1,30) -> c(1, 2, 3, ..., 29, 30) -> 1:30
a <- character(n) creates a charater vector a of length. Integer(n) and
numeric(n) create integer and numeric vectors of lenght n with entries 0
a <- vector(mode = "character", length = 10)

Logical Vectors
Comparisons in R output logical values TRUE, FALSE or NA
LOgical Comparisons;
They are: <, <=, >, >=, == for exact equality and != for inequlity.
