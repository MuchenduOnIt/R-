We don't have strings in R, instead we have character.
Other datatypes include;
  Logical -> TRUE, FALSE
  Numeric -> 12.3, 5, 999 (No floats)
  Integer -> 2l, 34l, 0l
  Complex -> 3 + 2i
  
  
  VECTORS
To create a vector use the c() function
  example
  apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
  
  LISTS
A list is an R-OBject that can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, function and even other lists inside it
  example
  list1 <- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)
  
  MATRICES
A matrix is a two-dimesional rectangular set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function
  example
  M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
  
  ARRAYS 
Arrays can be of any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute which creates an array which creates the required number of dimesion.
  example
  a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2))
  
  FACTORS
Factors are r-objects created using a vector. They stores the vector along with distinct values of the elements in the vectors as labels. The labels are always character 'string' irrespective of wheather it is numeric or character or Bool in the input vector.
  example
#create a vector
apple_colors <- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')
#create a factor
factor_apple <- factor(appple_colors)

  DATA FRAMES
They are tabular data objects. Unlike matrix in data frame, each column can contain different mode of data. The first column can be numeric while the second can be character and third col can be logical
  example
 BMI <- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
) 


  TYPES OF OPERATORS
Arithmetic operators -> +, -, *, /, ^
Relational operators -> ==, <, >,
Logical operators -> &, |, !
Assignment operators -> (<-, =, <<-, ->, ->>)
Miscellaneous operators -> :, %in%, %*%


NORMALITY TESTS
In statistics, normality test are used to determine if a data set is well
-modeled by a normal distribution and to compute how likely it is for a random
variable underlying the data set to be normally distributed. The two known
tests of normality are the  test and the Shapiro_Wilk test.

How to identify a data set is normally distributed?
-Display the box plot
  -to detect outlier
  
-present the histogram
  -to identify whether the figure is a bell shape or approximately normal]
  
-Quantile-quantile plot (qq plot)

-Shapiro test


THE RUNIF FUNCTION
runif can be used to produce random numbers; runif does not stand for run if.
runif(n) generates n uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.
runif(n, a, b) generates n uniform random numbers between a and b.

THE SET SEED()
Used for random number generation. It can only accept one integer.
Itis used along side other methods of simulation eg rnorm
